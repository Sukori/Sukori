## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Sukori/Sukori** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [minishell with moop250](https://github.com/moop250/minishell)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning at [42Lausanne](https://42lausanne.ch/)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... Nah, I'm fine for now.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... my skill issue.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... wait, too many people already bloat my mailbox at work. Don't ask me anything!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Depends on your distance. A trebuchet seems reasonable, but you may also need an intercontinental missile.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: I / you / He / she / we / you again / they (what is this question anyway? Do I need to prove that I know basic grammar on my github profile? Weird...)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Most laughter isn't because things are funny.
