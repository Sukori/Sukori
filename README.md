## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Sukori/Sukori** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [minishell with moop250](https://github.com/moop250/minishell)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning at [42Lausanne](https://42lausanne.ch/)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a Pokemon-like video game.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with assembly code.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about cats.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Depends on your distance. A trebuchet seems reasonable, but you may also need an intercontinental missile. On last resort, you can use my [website](https://technophil.dev)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Most laughter isn't because things are funny.
